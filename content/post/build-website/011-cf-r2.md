## R2 vs S3

[Cloudflare R2 vs AWS S3 | Review Pricing & Features | Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/pg-cloudflare-r2-vs-aws-s3/)

## Install mc (MinIO Client)

```shell
# just install minio client not minio server
brew install minio/stable/mc

mc alias set r2 R2-URL AccessKey SecretKey
```

> The MinIO client provides identical commands to Unix file management commands, such as cp and ls, but is designed for both local and remote storage systems. It’s fully compatible with AWS S3.

## Common Commands

```shell
mc ls <ALIAS>/<BucketName>: List all objects in a bucket.

mc cp -r <LOCAL-FOLDER-PATH> <ALIAS>/<BUCKET>/<REMOTE-FOLDER-PATH>: Upload a folder to a bucket.

mc rm <ALIAS>/<BUCKET>/<OBJECT>: Remove an object.
```

## PicGo with R2

> sudo spctl --master-disable

> xattr -cr /Applications/PicGo.app

You need install a S3 plugin to use R2 as a storage service.

CORS Problems:

Safari shows in console:

```
[Error] Preflight response is not successful
[Error] XMLHttpRequest cannot load [https://xxxxxxxxxxxx](https://xxxxxxxxxxxx/) due to access control checks.
```

Same as the out put below in Chrome:
```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://xxxxxxxxxxx' from origin 'xxxx' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

This means the OPTIONS calls is failing, even if all the headers (allow-origin etc....) are availables server-side.
