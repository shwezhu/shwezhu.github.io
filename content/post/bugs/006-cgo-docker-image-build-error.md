I choose a sqilte3 library which uses cgo, the Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM golang:alpine

WORKDIR /app
COPY ./ ./
RUN go mod download
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o /server .

CMD ["./server"]
```

> The `CGO_ENABLED=0` is to disable cgo. `GOOS=linux` and `GOARCH=arm64` is used for cross compilation in Go. Because I build this on my macOS arm64 machine, and I want build for Ubuntu amd64 machine, so I choose `GOOS=linux` `GOARCH=arm64`.

After build successfully and run image:

```shell
$ docker run -p 80:80 shwezhu/file-station:v1
2023/10/10 02:15:15 /app/main.go:12
[error] failed to initialize database, got error Binary was compiled with 'CGO_ENABLED=0', go-sqlite3 requires cgo to work. This is a stub
```

As you can see, apparently I will get an error, because my Go code use the `go-sqlite3 ` package which implemented by pure cgo, if I disable cgo with `CGO_ENABLED=0`, this will wrong. Then I change the dockerfile to:

```dockerfile
...
# Install gcc to compile cgo
RUN apk add --no-cache --update go gcc g++
RUN go build -o /server .

CMD ["./server"]
```

And build image with command:

```shell
$ docker build -t shwezhu/file-station:v2 .
```

There is an error when run the image on EC2 server:

```shell
$ docker run -p 80:80 shwezhu/file-station:v1
WARNING: The requested image's platform (linux/arm64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/amd64) and no specific platform was requested
```

Because my local machine is arm64, which means the image will be built to arm64 by default, but my EC2 server is linux/amd64, so there is an error occurred. With `--platform`, you can specify the platform this image built for:

```shell
$ docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t shwezhu/file-station:v2 .
```

*Go* is a statically *compiled* language. To execute a *Go* binary on a machine, it must be *compiled* for the matching operating system and processor architecture. So there is cross-compilation in Go. 

`--platform` is used to build [multi-platform docker images](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/), not build Go binary for another platform. You should know the difference between these concepts.
